# rPPG-10

### Abstract
Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its potential to enable non-contact, cost-effective methods for estimating physiological parameters, such as heart rate. This technology leverages subtle color variations in the skin caused by blood volume changes to extract cardiac signals from facial video recordings. Despite its promising applications in healthcare and other relevant areas, rPPG remains a highly experimental technique with several limitations. One of the major challenges in advancing research is the lack of diverse and complex datasets that can facilitate the development and validation of robust models. To address this gap, this article presents a novel dataset specifically designed for the study and improvement of remote heart rate estimation methods. This dataset aims to support the development of improved rPPG techniques and facilitate their transition from experimental research to real-world applications. The dataset consists of long-duration (10-minute) facial video recordings captured under natural lighting conditions. Unlike many existing datasets, which often feature controlled illumination and short recording durations, this dataset provides a more realistic scenario for evaluating rPPG algorithms in real-world conditions. By offering extended video recordings, it enables researchers to analyze the long-term stability of rPPG signals and assess the impact of natural lighting variations on heart rate estimation. The videos were recorded with a standard webcam to further assimilate a real-world scenario. The dataset also includes an electrocardiogram recording for each subject, ensuring a trustworthy ground-truth.
